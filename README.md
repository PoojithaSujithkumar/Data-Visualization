📊 Data Visualization – Data Science Internship Project

📌 Project Overview  
This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The goal was to visually explore restaurant data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights using various types of charts and plots.

📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes:
- Restaurant ratings
- Cuisines, cities, and countries
- Service features and vote counts

🛠️ Tech Stack  
Programming Language: Python  
Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🔍 Workflow  
✅ Created visualizations to represent the **distribution of ratings** (histograms, bar plots)  
✅ Compared **average ratings** across **cuisines** and **cities** using grouped bar plots  
✅ Explored the **relationship between multiple features** (e.g., price, delivery, votes) and the **Aggregate Rating**  
✅ Used heatmaps and scatter plots for multivariate analysis

📈 Results  
- Gained visual understanding of customer ratings distribution  
- Identified top-performing cuisines and cities based on average ratings  
- Discovered how various restaurant features correlate with ratings

🚀 Key Learnings  
- Enhanced skills in using Matplotlib and Seaborn for data storytelling  
- Learned to convert raw data into meaningful visuals for decision-making  
- Improved ability to communicate insights clearly through plots

🌟 Acknowledgment  
This project was completed as part of my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**, where I’m developing real-world data analysis and visualization skills.
